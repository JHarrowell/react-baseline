# React Baseline

This is my boilerplate project starter kit, based on [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) by Facebook. This repo is unejected which is not something you want to do unless you need to!

Packages included are:

*    [history](https://github.com/ReactTraining/history) - Easy session history management
*    [react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) - Quick and easy document head management
*    [react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) - React bindings for Redux
*    [react-router-dom](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-dom) - React DOM routing 
*    [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) - State management for JS Apps 
*    [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) - Component based styling with CSS and ES6
